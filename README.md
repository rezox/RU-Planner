# RU Planner

RU Planner is an attempt to redesign the way we navigate our degree. We want to make it easy and simple by telling the student exactly what they need to take.

## Info

* Look at our project [milestones](https://github.com/sjlu/RU-Planner/issues/milestones) to see what we plan on completing.
* Take a look at other [pages](https://github.com/sjlu/RU-Planner/wiki/_pages) for installation instructions, documentation and release notes.
